Trivia-Game ( Vue 3)

Project Description
Trivia Game is an interactive application that offers users a selection of 24 distinct categories.
Users are able to choose between four difficulty levels: easy, medium, difficult, or a random mix. Points
are awarded based on their answers.
Users must complete the quiz within a time limit of 3 minutes. After each question, they receive instant
feedback on whether their response was correct or not.
Additionally, the application provides users with their overall score and the number of questions they
answered correctly.
For each correctly answered question in the easy category, the user earns 10 points, while they receive
20 points for questions in the medium category and 30 points for those in the difficult category.
Incorrectly answered questions do not result in any negative points.
